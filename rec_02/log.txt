The POSIX and UNIX[29;1H       standards require that "ps -aux" print all processes owned by a user[30;1H       named "x", as well as printing all processes that would be selected by[31;1H       the -a option. If the user named "x" does not exist, this ps may[32;1H       interpret the command as "ps aux" instead and print a warning.

You can override this with the PS_FORMAT environment[46;1H       variable. The use of BSD-style options will also change the process[47;1H       selection to include processes on other terminals (TTYs) that are owned[48;1H       by you; alternately, this may be described as setting the selection to[49;1H       be the set of all processes filtered to exclude processes owned by[50;1H       other users or not on a terminal.
